### project plan

| Steps  | Mission |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Import data   |
| 2  | Data wrangling  |
| 3  | Map Region population  |
| 4  | Visualize relation (Rank egypt in world population Vs years)  |
| 5  | Select egypt and visualize relation (total population Vs years)  |
| 6  | Map top cities population  |
| 7  | Visualize top countries by graph  |


## 1-Import data
-All data used in this project is collected from this website <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#region/" target="_blank">Worldometer</a>

-You have to take into account that the data changes every second or maybe less than a second

## 2-Data wrangling
-In this step I created relationships and studied the most appropriate relationships to display, the data was clean, so I just focused on arranging them and creating relationships between the data only

## 3-Map Region population
